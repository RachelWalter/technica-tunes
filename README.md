Product of Technica 2016 (November 5, 2016)

Created a java file that acts as a Jukebox. Allows you to enter song names and links to make a Jukebox songlist. You can then play from the songlist file by clicking the appropriate buttons.

.jar file is the executable. You can access the code through the .java files. The .txt file is something you can upload into the executable and see how it works.
